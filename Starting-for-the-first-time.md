### 3. Provide Mining Address

When NiceHash QuickMiner is started for the first time, it will ask you for your **NiceHash Mining Address**. There is a link and a picture how to get this address. **This is a very important step - this is how NiceHash QuickMiner gets linked with your NiceHash account, so it mines for you and not somebody else**.

You can get your NiceHash Mining Address on your [Mining page](https://www.nicehash.com/my/mining/rigs). If you do not have NiceHash account, you have to create one. The mining address will look like this:`34HKWdzLxWBduUfJE9JxaFhoXnfC6gmePG`. NiceHash QuickMiner will not let you enter wrong address, you just have to make sure that you are entering **your** address and not somebody else's.

* launch OCTune tool (explained here),
* enable or disable CPU mining,
* set NiceHash QuickMiner to start with Windows and
* exit.

### 5. Startup with Windows?

If you would like NiceHash QuickMiner to startup with Windows, then you have to enable this option. There are two possibilities. You should **enable only one**. The recommended one is to start it with `Task scheduler method`. But if this method does not work for you somehow, try it by enabling `Service method`.
