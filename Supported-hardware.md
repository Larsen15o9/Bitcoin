Note the above models are **only** desktop variants. Notebook variants are not tested and we do not recommend using notebook video cards for mining due to extreme heat generated. If the video card is not on the list above, it may still (partially) work. Some Quadro and Tesla versions may work. We are working on bringing full compatibility to these models as well.

Additionally to the above video cards, if your PC has capable CPU, you can enable CPU mining. Following CPUs are supported:
* All Intel CPUs with AVX2 support
* All AMD CPUs with AVX2 support

**NOTE: CPU mining is only addition to GPU mining. You cannot use QuickMiner to only do CPU mining without GPU mining - it does not work. Please use [NiceHash Miner](https://github.com/nicehash/NiceHashMiner) if you plan to do only CPU mining.**
