# How can I get good speed with GeForce GTX 1080 and GTX 1080 Ti?

1. Download latest release from [here](https://github.com/nicehash/NiceHashQuickMiner/releases).
2. Install or unzip.
3. Run _NiceHashQuickMiner.exe_.
4. Your AV (or Windows Defender) might interfere here claiming software is PUA (potentially unwanted application). **You need to make sure to allow _NiceHashQuickMiner.exe_ and _excavator.exe_. Not doing this step may result in unexpected behavior - most likely mining will not work at all.**
5. First dialog after starting app will ask you for your NiceHash Mining Address. Login to NiceHash and go to [Rig Manager](https://www.nicehash.com/my/mining/rigs). Click on button `MINING ADDRESS` as visible in the picture below. The long code displayed is your Mining Address.

6. Next dialog is optional and you can skip it, but we suggest not to - set name of your worker and error handling mechanism.
7. At the end, go to [Rig Manager](https://www.nicehash.com/my/mining/rigs) again where you should see your mining Rig. Click on it and a list of mining devices will be displayed.

8. You can control each mining device - start or stop it and apply [OPTIMIZE](https://github.com/nicehash/NiceHashQuickMiner/wiki/One-click-Optimizations) profile.
9. Select optimization that you prefer. Boom! Your GeForce GTX 1080 or GTX 1080 Ti will suddenly hash much faster. **Up to 32 MH/s is expected for GeForce GTX 1080 and up to 45 MH/s for GeForce GTX 1080 Ti**, depending on optimization selected.
