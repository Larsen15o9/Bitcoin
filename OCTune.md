**Finding most efficient or the fastest combination of OC values for your card(s)**

Use OCTune. Look for values `Min KT` and `Avg KT`. Your goal is to get these values as low as possible. What is the meaning of these values? KT = Kernel Time. It is execution time of code running on GPU in microseconds. Min = minimal time (in previous X runs) and Avg = average time. Min can sometimes drop down to half of usual - you should ignore these values.

_1. Find your max memory clock_
First, you should find your max memory speed or determine at what memory speed you are prepared to run your GPU. Higher power limit and lower core clock can help memory stability. Therefore, set power limit to some high value (can be at 100% of your TDP - note the value needs to be in Watts!) and core clock to -600. Then increase memory clock by 25 each step and test at least several minutes. There should be no `HW err` and make sure there are at least 3 accepted shares on that card (`HW ok` increases by 3 at that speed). Once you find your max memory clock, you can go to step 2.

_2. Reduce power limit_
Now you can start reducing power limit. At some point, `Min KT` and `Avg KT` will start rising. That is a sign that you need to back off and stop reducing power limit (temporary). Now you need to increase core clock. Go to step 3.

_3. Increase core clock_
Increase core clock +25 at a time until your `Min KT` and `Avg KT` stop improving (values do not go lower anymore). Note that higher core clock can affect stability of your memory. You may have to decrease your memory clock if there are rejected shares (share above target) and value in `HW err` increases. Once you find ideal core clock, you can again try with reducing power limit.

_4. Play with settings to achieve best KT values_
You have to fiddle with core clock, memory clock and power limit until you find best KT values (lowest) and max stability (no shares above target - `HW err` stays at 0). Once you find best values, you will have the highest possible speed. You can save your OC configuration (click `Save current configuration`) so it will be applied next time Excavator is started.
